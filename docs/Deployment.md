## Overview
This document provides instructions for deploying the **Payment Application** using Docker and Docker Compose. It covers both **local development** and **production deployment**.

---

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- **Docker** ([Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- **Docker Compose** ([Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))
- **Node.js** (for local development, optional)

---

## Project Structure
The project uses the following key files:
- `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for the application.
- `docker-compose.local.yml`: For local development.
- `docker-compose.yml`: For production deployment.

---

## Dockerfile
The `Dockerfile` is optimized for performance and security. Hereâ€™s the content:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM node:20-alpine AS build

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --verbose

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application (if needed)
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Create a lightweight production image
FROM node:20-alpine AS release

WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the necessary files from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/package*.json ./
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production --verbose

# Set the user to a non-root user for security
USER node

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "dist/main.js"]
```

## Local Development Setup

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```

### Access the Application

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Swagger**: `http://localhost:3000/swagger


## Production Deployment

### 1. Build the Docker Images

Run the following command to build the production Docker images:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```


### 2. Start the Application

Start the application in detached mode:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```


## Docker Compose Files
### `docker-compose.local.yml` (Local Development)

```bash
services:
  back:
    image: node:20-alpine
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - ./:/app
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      - MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/payment
      - API_PORT=3000
    command: npm run start:dev

  mongo:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
    volumes:
      - mongo:/data/db

volumes:
  mongo:
```
